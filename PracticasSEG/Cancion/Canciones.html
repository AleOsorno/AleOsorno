            I don't know why<br>
            You think that you could hold me<br>
            When you couldn't get by by yourself<br>
            And I don't know who<br>
            Would ever want to tear the seam of someone's dream<br>
            Baby, it's fine, you said that we should just be friends<br>
            While I came up with that line and I'm sure<br>
            That it's for the best<br>
            If you ever change your mind, don't hold your breath<br>
            'Cause you may not believe<br>
            That baby, I'm relieved, hmm<br>
            When you said goodbye, my whole world shines<br>
            Hey hey hey<br>
            It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself from smiling<br>
            If we're drinking, then I'm buying<br>
            And I know there's no denying<br>
            It's a beautiful day, the sun is up, the music's playing<br>
            And even if it started raining<br>
            You won't hear this boy complaining<br>
            'Cause I'm glad that you're the one who got away<br>
            It's a beautiful day<br>
            It's my turn to fly, so girls, get in line<br>
            'Cause I'm easy, no playing this guy like a fool<br>
            Now I'm alright<br>
            Might've had me caged before, but not tonight<br>
            And you may not believe, hmm<br>
            That baby, I'm relieved<br>
            This fire inside, it burns too bright<br>
            I don't want to say "So long", I just want to say "Goodbye"<br>
            It's a beautiful day and I can't stop myself from smiling<br>
            If we're drinking, then I'm buying<br>
            And I know there's no denying<br>
            That it's a beautiful day, the sun is up, the music's playing<br>
            And even if it started raining<br>
            You won't hear this boy complaining<br>
            'Cause I'm glad that you're the one who got away, hmm<br>
            'Cause if you ever think I'll take up<br>
            My time with thinking of our break-up<br>
            Then, you've got another thing coming your way<br>
            'Cause it's a beautiful day<br>
            Beautiful day<br>
            Oh, baby, any day that you're gone away<br>
            It's a beautiful day<br>
        </p>
